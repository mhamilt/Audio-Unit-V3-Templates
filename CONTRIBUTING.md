# Contributing to AUv3 Template

Thank you for wanting contribute to these templates. Xcode and Apple's APIs seem to move quickly and regularly break code that is not robustly put together. If you notice anything amiss, please [flag an issue](https://github.com/mhamilt/Audio-Unit-V3-Templates/issues/new/choose) or fork this repo and submit a pull request.
